		INTRODUCTION
============================

No Q is a website seeking to solve our university's restaurant issues; mainly long queues and inadequate food quantities.
It also seeks to eliminate food/bread waste.
Every night, A chef has to fill out a form containing the next day's meal (Name,Picture,Ingredients)
Students may then log in and fill out a small form to indicate whether they will be eating at the restaurant the next day and if yes, they may enter the 
amount of bread they will be consuming so that bread waste is minimized.

This information can then be viewed by the chef who will have a better estimation of the amount of food needed; thus, reducing waste.

site users are : chefs & students


-The starting page is "Home.php"

============================
		Sign-up.php
============================

The sign-up page is for student sign-up. The restaurant only has 2 chefs with pre-made accounts.
Registering a new chef account is NOT possible.


The site checks for the availability of the email, the level of security of the password, and the validity of the phone number before registering a new student.
The student also has to specify whether they have food allergies.
It then redirects the user to the student login page.


=============================
	  Student_Login.php
=============================

Straight-forward login page for students.
Redirects to Student_dashboard.php if the credentials are correct.



=============================
	   Chef_Login.php
=============================

Straight-forward login page for chefs.
Redirects to Form_chef.php if the credentials are correct.



=============================
		Form_chef.php
=============================

The chef is presented with a form that must be filled to add a new Meal to the database. (Name,Photo,Ingredients)
Uploaded file must be jpg,jpeg,png or Gif else it will fail.


=============================
	   prev_meals.php
=============================

This page is only available to chefs. It displays up to the last 5 meals along with basic information such as date and pic as well as crucial data 
such as #_coming (number of people coming) #_bread (Bread pieces consumed)

This serves to reduce food and bread waste.


==============================
	 Student_Dashboard.php
==============================

Students are presented with the latest meal submitted by the chef.
If the Meal table is empty it displays "No meal for the day"

In case the Meal table is not empty.
The meal picture is displayed up top.
If the student has an allergy it lists all ingredients.
The student may then choose to fill the small form; specifying whether they will be coming to the restaurant and the amount of bread they will consume.
Once the student sumbits the form, the database updates the no_coming and no_bread columns in the Meal table according to the form response.
The student will NOT be able to modify their response.

============================
