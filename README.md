# No Q: University Restaurant Queue and Waste Management

## Introduction

No Q is a website designed to address our university's restaurant issues, primarily long queues and inadequate food quantities. It also aims to eliminate food and bread waste. 

- Every night, a chef fills out a form with the next day's meal (Name, Picture, Ingredients).
- Students log in to fill out a form indicating whether they will be eating at the restaurant the next day and the amount of bread they will consume to minimize bread waste.

This information helps chefs better estimate the amount of food needed, thus reducing waste.

### Site Users
- **Chefs**
- **Students**

### Starting Page
- `Home.php`

## Sign-up.php

The sign-up page is for student sign-up. The restaurant only has two chefs with pre-made accounts. Registering a new chef account is not possible.

- The site checks for the availability of the email, the level of security of the password, and the validity of the phone number before registering a new student.
- Students must specify if they have food allergies.
- After registration, the user is redirected to the student login page.

## Student_Login.php

A straightforward login page for students.

- Redirects to `Student_dashboard.php` if the credentials are correct.

## Chef_Login.php

A straightforward login page for chefs.

- Redirects to `Form_chef.php` if the credentials are correct.

## Form_chef.php

Chefs are presented with a form to add a new meal to the database.

- Required fields: Name, Photo, Ingredients
- Uploaded files must be in jpg, jpeg, png, or gif format; otherwise, the upload will fail.

## prev_meals.php

This page is available only to chefs. 

- Displays up to the last five meals with basic information such as date and picture.
- Displays crucial data such as the number of people coming (#_coming) and the number of bread pieces consumed (#_bread).

This helps reduce food and bread waste.

## Student_Dashboard.php

Students are presented with the latest meal submitted by the chef.

- If the Meal table is empty, it displays "No meal for the day".
- If the Meal table is not empty, the meal picture is displayed at the top.
  - Lists all ingredients if the student has an allergy.
  - Students can fill out a form specifying whether they will be coming to the restaurant and the amount of bread they will consume.
  - Once the student submits the form, the database updates the no_coming and no_bread columns in the Meal table according to the form response.
  - Students cannot modify their response after submission.

## Notes

- The sign-out button clears the sessions and redirects to the login pages.
- It is not possible to open `student_dashboard.php`, `Form_chef.php`, and `prev_meals.php` without logging in.
- Meal photos are stored in the Meal Images folder.
- Styling and scripting files can be found in the Styles and Scripts directories respectively.
- The images directory only contains the background image for the first three pages.
- The .idea folder can be ignored as it is generated by the IDE used (PhpStorm).
